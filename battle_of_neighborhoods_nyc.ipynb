    "*Cluster 2*: in this cluster the italian restaurants and pizzeria represent the most popular venues, especially in Madison neighborhood, where opening an italian restaurant or pizzeria could lead to high competition due to the other similar commercial businesses already present. However, **Canarsie** neighborhood could be a valid choice to open italian restaurant or pizzeria,  because it has a high population density and there aren't competing activities. However, the presence of other ethnic restaurants, although not italian, should not be underestimated."

    "The purpose of this project was to identify neighborhoods in New York with a low presence of restaurants, especially Italian restaurants or pizzeria, in order to aid stakeholders in narrowing down the search for optimal location for a new Italian restaurant/pizzeria.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we analyzed which could be the best borough to open the restaurant. The analysis led us to choose Brooklyn, thanks to its higher population density than other boroughs. Then, by finding restaurants presence in  each Brooklyn'S neighborhood from Foursquare data we have clustered them. Clustering those locations was performed in order to create major zones of interest (containing greatest number of potential locations) which satisfy some basic requirements regarding existing nearby italian restaurants/pizzeria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final decision about the best italian restaurant/pizzeria location will be made by stakeholders based on the specific characteristics of neighborhoods and locations in every recommended zone, taking into consideration additional factors like attractiveness of each location (proximity to park or water), levels of noise / proximity to major roads, real estate availability, prices, social and economic dynamics of every neighborhood etc."
